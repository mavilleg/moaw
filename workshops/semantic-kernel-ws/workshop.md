# Semantic Kernel Workshop

This is an envisioning workshop, based on Microsoft's Copilot stack [Microsoft's Copilot stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/#semantic-kernel-is-at-the-center-of-the-copilot-stack), to rethink user experience, architecture, and app development by leveraging the intelligence of foundation models. This workshop will use Semantic Kernel (SK), along with SK's Design thinking material, to guide you through the lifecycle of intelligent app development.
